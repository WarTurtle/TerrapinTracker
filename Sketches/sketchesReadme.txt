Sketch descriptions

GnatTurtleTracker_Tide_v4

This sketch uses print statements for debugging and monitoring program flow. This version is designed to have the GPS collect locations points at a specific sampling frequency around high tide and another sampling frequency otherwise.  

GnatTurtleTracker_Tide_NoPrints_v1
This is similar to GnatTurtleTracker_Tide_v4 but does not have print statements since it is designed to be run at 4.2 MHz clock speed and serial output is not possible.
